# NSEC walk script for DNSSEC - developed by acidvegas (https://git.acid.vegas/nsecx)

# This script will walk through a DNS zone using NSEC records.

# TLD to start the walk from
tld="$1"

# Initialize the top-level domain (TLD) to start the walk from
current_domain="$tld"

# Loop to walk through the zone using NSEC records
while true; do
    # Perform the dig command to get the NSEC record for the current domain
    output="$(dig +trace $current_domain NSEC)"

    # Use grep to find the line with the current domain and then use awk to extract the next domain
    next_domain=$(echo "$output" | grep -F "$current_domain" | awk '$4 == "NSEC" { print $5 }')

    # Check if we got a valid next domain
    if [ -z "$next_domain" ] || [ "$next_domain" = "$current_domain" ]; then
        echo "$output"
        echo "End of zone reached or no more domains found."
        break
    fi

    # Print the next domain
    echo "Next domain: $next_domain"

    # Update the current domain to the next one for the following iteration
    current_domain=$next_domain
done
